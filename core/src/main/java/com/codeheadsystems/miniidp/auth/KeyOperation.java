/**
 * The data-plane operations a client may be granted against a key group.
 *
 * <p>This is a deliberate mirror of mini-kms's {@code KeyOperation} enum. mini-idp does not
 * <em>perform</em> any of these operations; it only names them so that an issued token can
 * carry a set of granted operations per key group. When the future mini-kms verifies one of
 * our tokens it can map this set straight onto its own {@code KeyOperation} /
 * {@code KeyAuthorizationPolicy} without a translation table.
 *
 * <p>Keep these names byte-for-byte identical to mini-kms's enum constants — the contract is
 * the string value that travels in the JWT claim, so a rename here silently breaks the KMS's
 * ability to parse a grant.
