/**
 * The complete authorization payload granted to a client, carried inside an issued token.
 *
 * <p>It is the union of the two planes mini-kms distinguishes:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code controlPlane} — whether the client may perform key-management (admin) operations.
 *       This maps directly onto mini-kms's {@code Principal.admin} flag: a verified token with
 *       {@code controlPlane = true} becomes an admin principal there.</li>
 *   <li>{@code grants} — the per-key-group data-plane {@link KeyOperation}s the client may
 *       perform. mini-kms feeds these to its {@code KeyAuthorizationPolicy}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The clientId is NOT stored here; it is the token subject ({@code sub}) and becomes the
 * mini-kms {@code Principal.id}. This separation keeps the authorization payload purely about
 * "what may be done", with "who" supplied by the subject claim.
 *
 * @param controlPlane whether the client is authorized for control-plane (admin) operations.
 * @param grants       the per-key-group data-plane grants; may be empty (a control-only or
 *                     deliberately-unprivileged client).
